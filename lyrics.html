        Come on, shake your body baby, do the conga
        I know you can't control yourself any longer
        
        Come on, shake your body baby, do the conga
        I know you can't control yourself any longer
        
        Come on, shake your body baby, do the conga
        I know you can't control yourself any longer
        Feel the rhythm of the music getting stronger
        Don't you fight it till you've tried it do the conga beat
        
        Everybody gather 'round now
        Let your body feel the heat
        Don't you worry if you can't dance
        Let the music move your feet
        
        It's the rhythm of the island
        And like sugarcane, so sweet
        If you want to do the conga
        You've got to listen to the beat
        
        Come on, shake your body baby, do the conga
        I know you can't control yourself any longer
        Feel the rhythm of the music getting stronger
        Don't you fight it till you've tried it do the conga beat

        Feel the fire of desire
        As you dance the night away
        'Cos tonight we're gonna party
        Till we see the break of day
        
        Better get yourself together
        And hold on to what you got
        Once the music hits your system
        There's no way you're gonna stop
        
        Come on, shake your body baby, do the conga
        I know you can't control yourself any longer
        Feel the rhythm of the music getting stronger
        Don't you fight it till you've tried it do the conga beat
        
        Come on, shake your body baby, do the conga
        I know you can't control yourself any longer
        Feel the rhythm of the music getting stronger
        Don't you fight it till you've tried it, do the conga
        
        Come on, shake your body baby, do the conga
        I know you can't control yourself any longer
        Feel the rhythm of the music getting stronger
        Don't you fight it till you've tried it do the conga beat
        
        Come on, shake your body baby, do the conga
