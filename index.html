    <dl style="background-color:lightblue; border: 2px solid; padding: 5px;">
      <dt><b>Dragon</b></dt>
      <dd>A "dragon" is a legendary and mythical creature often depicted as a large, serpentine or reptilian creature with features such as scales, claws, wings, and sometimes the ability to breathe fire. Dragons appear in various cultures and mythologies around the world, often symbolizing power, strength, and sometimes both benevolent and malevolent forces. They have played roles in literature, folklore, and popular culture, ranging from fearsome beasts to wise and mystical beings. The depiction and characteristics of dragons can vary widely, depending on the cultural context and the stories in which they appear.</dd>
      <br>
      <dt><b>Phoenix</b></dt>
      <dd>A "phoenix" is a mythical bird often associated with themes of rebirth, renewal, and immortality. In various mythologies and cultures, the phoenix is said to have the ability to cyclically regenerate or resurrect from its own ashes after its death, symbolizing the cycle of life, death, and rebirth.

        The phoenix is typically described as a large, majestic bird with radiant and colorful plumage, often featuring shades of red, orange, and gold. It is believed to live for hundreds of years before undergoing a process of self-immolation, during which it is consumed by flames and reduced to ashes. From these ashes, a new phoenix emerges, representing a fresh beginning and the continuation of its existence.
        
        The concept of the phoenix has appeared in diverse mythologies, including Greek, Egyptian, Chinese, and Persian. Across these cultures, the phoenix holds a profound and enduring significance, embodying themes of transformation, resilience, and the eternal cycle of life.</dd>
      <br>
      <dt><b>Vampire</b></dt>
      <dd>A "vampire" is a mythical or folkloric creature often depicted as an undead being that sustains itself by consuming the blood of the living. Vampires are commonly associated with supernatural abilities such as immortality, enhanced strength, heightened senses, and the ability to transform into bats or other creatures. They are often portrayed as creatures of the night, sensitive to sunlight and often needing to rest in their coffins during the day.

        The concept of vampires has evolved over time, with various cultures and literary works contributing to their portrayal. One of the most famous literary representations of vampires is Bram Stoker's novel "Dracula," which popularized many aspects of vampire mythology that persist in modern interpretations.
        
        Vampire lore has appeared in folklore and mythology from different parts of the world, including Eastern Europe, the Balkans, and various cultures in Asia. In recent times, vampires have become prominent figures in popular culture, featuring in literature, movies, television shows, and other forms of media, often depicted with a range of characteristics beyond their traditional roots.</dd>
      <br>
      <dt><b>Werewolf</b></dt>
      <dd>A "werewolf" is a legendary creature often depicted in folklore and mythology as a person who can transform into a wolf or a wolf-like creature, typically during a full moon. The transformation is usually involuntary and is often associated with a curse or a supernatural affliction.

        Werewolves are characterized by their dual nature - human and wolf - and are often depicted as possessing enhanced physical abilities, such as increased strength, speed, and heightened senses, while in their wolf form. They are also often depicted as having a strong connection to nature and exhibiting primal instincts.
        
        Legends of werewolves have appeared in various cultures around the world, with variations in the specifics of the transformation process, the triggers for transformation, and the characteristics of the werewolf. These stories often explore themes of inner conflict, the struggle between human reason and animalistic instincts, and the challenges of controlling one's nature.
        
        Similar to vampires, werewolves have also become popular figures in literature, movies, and other forms of media, where their mythos has been expanded upon and reimagined in various ways beyond their original folklore roots.</dd>
